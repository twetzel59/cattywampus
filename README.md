# Tiny concatenative, stack-based calculator and evaluator

Currently being rewritten in Rust.

I'm currently busy with school, but I hope to make this a fairly advanced calculator (in the form of a stack language interpreter) with the following features:
* Basic arithmetic
* Math functions
* String functions
* Saving and loading programs
* Very strong (albeit dynamic) type checking
